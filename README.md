# image-manipulator

what the program does: once you open an image of your choice, you can bring the image to the original resolution with ++Res, lower the resolution with --Res, and whereever you click on the image, it will save the colour of the pixel you clicked, and then clicking Find will find the other pixels in the image that are the exact same colour as the pixel you clicked, and highlight them in red. clicking exit closes the program.

in order to open an image, type `java Gui (filename.image)` and the program will open your image.
